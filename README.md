# CircleCI build image for Ruby

This is pretty uninteresting, just a CircleCI build image I use for
some projects to cache some Ubuntu dependencies needed for builds.

To build locally, run `make`.  You can see automatic builds at
[Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/apiology/circleci-ruby)
